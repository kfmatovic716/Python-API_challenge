# Weather & Vacation Analysis 

This Python script utilizes OpenWeatherMap API to analyze and visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. The main focus is to determine the vacation destination based on weather preferences. 

Ideal weather is defined as follows:

- Temperature: 75 to 85 degree Fahrenheit
- Humidity level (%): 14 to 57
- Cloudiness (%): none
- Wind Speed (mph): less than 10

Trends in Weather pattern with respect to city locations:

1. Cities located farther from the equator, whether going towards the direction of the Nothern or Southern Hemisphere, tend to have a lower and more comfortable temperatures. Cities located near or at the equator experience temperatures between 80 to 100 degree Fahrenheit while cities that are in the Northern Hemisphere experience temperatures less than 80 degrees F.

2. Northern Hemisphere shows higher humidity levels due to more dense population of cities than in the Southern Hemisphere. The humidity levels are from 75% and over for latitudes 30-70. 

3. Southern Hemisphere cities that are closest to the equator experience lower wind speeds. Cities located in -25 to 0 latitudes have wind speeds less than 15 mph.
